      <h3>Intro to CAPS</h3>
      <br>
            <p>CAPS offers both in-person and virtual services. CAPS is committed to creating an environment based on our values of multicultural, multi-disciplinary and multi-theoretical practices that allow our diverse student body to access care, receive high quality services and take positive pathways to mental health. </p>
            <br>
            <p>CAPS has a limited number of private spaces available for students to connect with their counselor via telecounseling. Please contact the front desk for more information on those private spaces. Please Note: During high-demand periods, CAPS will be unable to accommodate class-related interviews and/or projects. Many students are able to find the information they need within our website and our annual reports. </p>
            <br>
            <p>CAPS office is unable to participate in scavenger hunts for students due to maintaining the confidentiality of our clients. However, you are welcome to direct students to the wellness zone, which has a separate entrance adjacent to CAPS. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the CAPS office. <a href="https://caps.umich.edu">CAPS Website</a></p>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <br>

            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>clinical service delivery</li>
                <li>prevention and education</li>
                <li>mental health wellness</li>

                <li>training a new generation of professionals</li> 
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>Our work also involves information, services, and tools to help students, staff, faculty, and family members. Together, we can achieve a campus climate of mental ‘health’ where each student can engage thoughtfully as an active community member and to help their fellow students.</p>
            <br>
        <h2>Clinical Services</h2>
        <br>
            <p>Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) provides confidential psychological services for currently enrolled U of M undergraduate and graduate students. CAPS strives to provide the following services in an atmosphere that is welcoming, comfortable and multi-culturally sensitive for all students. </p>
            <br>
        <h3>Make an appointment</h3>
        <br>
            <p>Your mental health is vitally important. We are here to support you in taking steps towards finding help for your concerns. CAPS has the following options for you to choose from to see a counselor:</p>
            <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>CAPS Counselors in the Central Office: Schedule an appointment online to meet with an Initial Access Specialist who will work with you to determine the best next step in addressing your mental health needs. You can also stop by our office on the fourth floor of the Michigan Union or call us at 734-764-8312 for assistance in scheduling an initial consultation. Appointments are available in person or virtually.</li>
                    <li>CAPS Counselors in the Schools and Colleges: Some of the CAPS therapists are located in different Schools and Colleges at U-M. To see a CAPS therapist in your School/College, please follow this link to find your embedded therapist. Then, email them directly, and they will send you the online scheduling information.</li>
                    <li>Uwill Teletherapy Services: Uwill serves as an extension of the care provided through CAPS, allowing us to expand our service capacity for students. The partnership provides students with free video, phone, chat and message sessions with licensed mental health professionals free of charge. Teletherapy services are available during evenings and weekends, and holidays, providing the most flexibility for meeting your scheduling needs. Because Uwill teletherapy may not be appropriate for all presenting concerns, if you have any questions, please contact us to determine if Uwill is a good fit for you. Following the consultation, the CAPS team member may refer you to Uwill or to CAPS based on your needs.</li>
                    <li>Urgent/Crisis Needs: If you are experiencing an urgent need or crisis then please call CAPS at 734-764-8312 at any time 24/7 or come into our office located on the fourth floor of the Michigan Union during our regular office hours. This is a same-day service and students are seen on a first-come, first-served basis.</li>
                </ul>
                    <p> At the University of Michigan, we recognize there is no “one size fits all” approach to supporting student mental health. That's why we provide a variety of options to meet a diversity of needs.</p>

    <h3>Outreach and Community Engagement</h3>
    <br>
    <p>*Note: Please give us at least 3 weeks in advance for all presentation requests. Due to CAPS staff meeting time, workshop presentations will not be held on Tuesdays from 9am-12:00pm.</p>
    <br>
        <p>
        CAPS Community Engagement and Outreach is multi-faceted and comprehensive.  Simply, it's a way to reach all 46,000 of our University of Michigan students.  Together, we can all change the story about college student mental health.</p>
        <br>
    <h4>What is Outreach?</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Outreach is about increasing college student mental health awareness through prevention, awareness, education and stigma reduction. Through outreach, CAPS staff are able to connect with the larger UM community and ultimately strengthen our “community of caring.” </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Who does CAPS reach through outreach?</h4>
    <br>
    <p>CAPS is essentially connecting with students who do not traditionally utilize individual or group therapy. These could include students who may want to know more about how to help a friend or students who may experience stigma about help seeking or students who may need support, but not necessarily counseling. CAPS creates a “web of support” not only for students, but also encourages staff and faculty involvement through a variety of education and prevention efforts.</p>
    <p>For more information on outreach, please follow this link: <a href= "https://caps.umich.edu/outreach"> CAPS Outreach</a></p>

    <h3>Resources</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The University's commitment to diversity and inclusiveness extends to students who have mental health concerns. The University is committed to the academic success, personal development and general health of all students. We want you to be successful and well.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        CAPS is committed to being the main mental health resource for all students.  We also know, oftentimes, a student's mental and emotional health needs are helped by other student support offices on campus, and/or a student's treatment needs are beyond the scope of CAPS.  This page organizes the many rich resources available at the University of Michigan and in our Ann Arbor community for student mental health and is intended for a variety of constituents -- students, faculty, staff, parents, family members, and loved ones. <a href="https://caps.umich.edu/resources">Resources</a></p>
